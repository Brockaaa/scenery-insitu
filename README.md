# scenery-insitu

A rendering system based on the [scenery](scenery.graphics) library that performs in situ visualization of parallel numerical simulations. It is instrumented to work with [OpenFPM](http://openfpm.mpi-cbg.de/) - an open-source framework for scalable particle- and mesh-based simulations. The application runs distributedly, reads simulation data from shared memory, and renders then composits it into a single image.

The development is in early-prototype phase.
